# Package Loading
Just like any other package, you need to request this package with a
`usepackage` command in the preamble. So in the simpler case (i.e.,
without any options), one just types
```
\usepackage{lstEventB}
```
to load the package

# Package Options
[lstEventB.sty](https://eventB-soton.github.io/lstEventB) currently support the following options

- `colour` | `color`: Enable the colours for Event-B code.
