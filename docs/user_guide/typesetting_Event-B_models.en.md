# Typsetting Event-B Code
The current supported syntax is from [CamilleX](https://github.com/eventB-Soton/XEventB). In particular, the Event-B mathematical symbols can be typeset using Unicode symbols. Alternatively, the mathematical symbols can be typeset using ASCII combinations (similar to the [Event-B Summary](https://wiki.event-b.org/images/EventB-Summary.pdf), with the exception that the text combinations must be prefixed by `!` (this is to prevent unintended translation of text in longer words). Some other symbols, e.g. `.` and `|` also need to be `!`-prefixed.

## Predicate-related Symbols
The following table shows  the ASCII input for typesetting predicate-related symbols.
